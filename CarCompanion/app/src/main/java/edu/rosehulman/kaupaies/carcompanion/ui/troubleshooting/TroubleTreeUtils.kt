For instance, when your thermostat fails, your engine won't work as well as it should. This is largely because these thermostats allow coolant to flow through the greater coolant system. A faulty thermostat could spell bigger engine issues down the road. Good news though: a new thermostat is inexpensive and can be installed fairly easily in less than an hour. How do you know whether or not your thermostat is bad? It's easy to test. Just start up your engine and put your hand on the radiator or its top hose. If it quickly warms up after a moment or two, it's working well. If it warms gradually from the start or doesn't warm up, you should look into thermostat replacement.\n"))

Along with your engine, the transmission is arguably the most important part of your vehicle. If either the engine or the transmission fails, you no longer have a drivable car. That's why getting the transmission cooling lines fixed when a problem arises is key to maintaining a well-functioning vehicle.

Because there are so many parts in the transmission - and because each of those parts is continually exposed to friction and heat - it is natural that your transmission components will experience more wear and tear than other, simpler, mechanisms in your vehicle makeup. Manual transmission vehicles need transmission fluid to keep gears lubricated and to prevent grinding. Automatic transmission vehicles need transmission fluid to create the hydraulic pressure that actually powers movement within the transmission. Without the right amount of clean and debris-free transmission fluid, transmissions can overheat and essential gears can slip, surge, or become ground down, and - especially in the case of automatic transmissions - total vehicle failure can occur.\n"))
